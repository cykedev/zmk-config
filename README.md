# zmk-config
This is the ZMK-Config repo for my [Scylla](https://bastardkb.com/scylla) by [Bastard Keyboards](https://bastardkb.com).

The board is printed based on [open sourced files](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Scylla) and uses [flexible PCBs for the body](https://github.com/Bastardkb/PCB_plate_DM) and the [thumb cluster](https://github.com/Bastardkb/PCB_Thumbs_DM) - this means that the pin mapping is matching to it.

The [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) is attached with [a holder](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Elite-C-holder).
